    "By now we all know what Random Forests is. We know about the great off-the-self performance, ease of tuning and parallelization, as well as it’s importance measures. It’s easy for engineers implementing RF to forget about it’s underpinnings. Unlike some of it's more modern and advanced contemporaries, descision trees are easy to interpret. A neural net might obtain great results but it is difficult to work backwards from and explain to stake holders as the weights of the connections between two neurons have little meaning on their own. Decision trees won't be a great choice for a feature space with complex relationships between numerical variables, but it's great for data with a simplier mix of numerical and categorical. \n",
